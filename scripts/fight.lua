===================
 BATTLE SIMULATION
===================

Input
-----
   monsters : list of monsters that the player must kill
              { info=MONSTER_INFO, is_cage=false }

   weapons : list of weapons that player can use
             { info=WEAPON_INFO, factor=1.0 }


Output
------
   stats : health that player needs to survive the battle +
           ammo quantities required by the player


Notes
-----

*  Results are all >= 0 and can be partial (like 3.62 rockets).

*  Health result is stored in the 'stats' table (as "health").

*  Monsters are "fought" one by one in the given list, sorted
   from the strongest to the weakest (an order similar to how the
   player would tackle them).

   Your weapons can damage other monsters though, via such things
   as rocket splash, BFG spray, and shotgun spread.
   
*  Weapons are "fired" in short rounds.  Each round the weapon is
   chosen based on their intrinsic 'pref' value (and modified by a
   'factor' value if present), as well as other things like the
   'weap_prefs' of the current monster.  The weapon's damage is
   used to decrease the monster's health, recording the ammo usage.
   Dead monsters get removed from the list.

*  Armor is not modelled here.  Instead you can assume that some
   percentage of the returned "health" would have been saved if
   the player was wearing armor.

*  Powerups like Invulnerability or Berserk are not modelled.
   Invulnerability could be handled by detecting which monsters
   (often bosses) to be fought and then simply omitting them
   from the simulation.  Other powerups are considered to be
   bonuses for the player.

*  Infighting between monsters is modelled very simplistically,
   as a small reduction to the health of every monsters.  See
   the comment below regarding the INFIGHT_FACTOR value.
